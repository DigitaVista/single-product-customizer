**What Our Single Product Customizer Plugin Offers**

Single Product Page Customizer with variation swatches provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to enhance the functionality, responsiveness, aesthetics, and user experience of your WooCommerce product pages.

**From advanced variation displays to streamlined checkout options, here's what this WooCommerce single product addon offers:**

= Cart & Quantity Management =

Optimizing the product fields and pages is essential for converting casual browsers into committed buyers on the WooCommerce store. The default WooCommerce interface, while functional, often lacks the nuance required for a truly seamless user experience. The following features of the single product page customizer with variation swatches for WooCommece plugin focus entirely on the transaction mechanism...

**Enable Plus, Minus Buttons for Increase/Decrease Quantity**

To improve the responsiveness of the WooCommerce store, this feature adds distinct Plus (+) and Minus (-) buttons next to the input product field. This allows users to adjust quantities effortlessly with a single click/tap and shop owners to maintain a properly responsive website.

[Live Demo of Plus Minus Button](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/enable-plus-minus-buttons/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/basic-plugin-configuration/enable-plus-minus-button/)

**Enable Ajax Add to Cart Button in Single Product Page**

Statistics show that people buy more items from the stores that have **Ajax add to cart** than the default WooCommerce settings. With our Single Product Page Customizer for WooCommerce product addon plugin, you can enable this **AJAX functionality**, allowing customers to add items to their cart instantly without refreshing the whole page.

[Live Demo of Ajax Add to Cart](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/enable-ajax-add-to-cart/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/enable-ajax-add-to-cart/)

**Change "Add to Cart" Button Text**

The standard "Add to Cart" label may not fit the tone or strategy of every online store. This option gives you the flexibility to rename the button to something more compelling or relevant to your specific products.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/single-product-meta-remove/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/basic-plugin-configuration/change-add-to-cart-button-text/)

**Hide "Add to Cart" Button**

For catalog-mode websites or products that are temporarily unavailable, displaying a purchasing button can be misleading. This feature allows you to completely remove the "Add to Cart" button from the WooCommerce product page, ensuring that users can view the product without the option to purchase.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/hide-add-to-cart-button/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/basic-plugin-configuration/hide-add-to-cart-button/)

**Enable Min/Max Quantity Limits**

With our Single Product Customizer for WooCommerce, you can enable minimum or maximum quantity limits for your products. This helps prevent the wholesale abuse and ensures that minimum order requirements are met. Every store owner needs to control purchase volumes to keep fairness in the business and avoid losses. Ultimately prevent customers from ordering too few or too many items in a single transaction.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/min-max-setup/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/enable-min-max-quantity/)

= Product Variation & Swatches for WooCommerce =

Displaying variable products effectively is one of the biggest challenges for online stores. Standard dropdown menus are often uninspiring and can hide important product options from immediate view, leading to customer confusion. By utilizing dynamic variation swatches in this WooCommerce single product page editor plugin​, you make it easier for shoppers to visualize their choices instantly. This custom product field addon for WooCommerce lets you design the variation and swatches effortlessly.

> Your suggestions are the most important factors that will make this plugin even better. So, please [let us know](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/single-product-customizer) your valuable opinion on our plugin.

**Product Variation Swatches for WooCommerce**

The **product variation swatches for WooCommerce** feature replaces standard dropdowns with interactive variation swatches for WooCommerce single product pages. This allows you to display product variations as Colors, Images, Radio Buttons, or Text Buttons for a modern, high-converting look.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/show-variation-swatches/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/enable-variation-switcher/)

**Variation Table Show for Variation Product**

The Variation Table feature of Single Product Page Customizer lists all available options in a structured table format. This makes it easier for customers to compare specifications and select the exact combination they need.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/show-variation-table/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/show-variation-table/)

**Variation Reset Text Change**

The small "Clear" text that appears after a customer selects a variation is often easy to overlook. This feature in our WooCommerce product page editor allows you to customize the text of this reset link to something more descriptive, such as "Reset Selection" or "Clear Options," improving navigation clarity.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/reset-text-change/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/variation-reset-text/)

= Layout & Visibility Control =

A cluttered WooCommerce product page can distract customers and dilute your primary call to action. The default WooCommerce layout often includes metadata, like SKUs, tags, and categories, that may not be relevant to your specific audience. Single Product Customizer has all of these features that solve the timely problems.

You can easily toggle the visibility of specific elements, hiding price tags for catalog-mode sites or removing related product sections to prevent user exit. Beyond simple hiding, you gain control over the structural layout, such as moving image galleries or adjusting grid formats with our WooCommerce product page editor.

**Remove Product SKU, Category, Tag Name**

Product pages often become cluttered with metadata that is irrelevant to the average shopper. This feature in our WooCommerce single product page customizer provides a simple toggle to hide the SKU, Category, and Tag information. Thus, resulting in a cleaner interface that keeps the focus entirely on the product and the call-to-action.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/remove-meta-rating/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/basic-plugin-configuration/remove-product-meta/)

**Remove Related Product Section**

While cross-selling is valuable, the default "Related Products" section can sometimes distract users or clutter the bottom of the page. With our single product customizer plugin, you can control whether you want to show or remove the related product section. Easily customize WooCommerce product pages and disable this section entirely. This is crucial for high-ticket items or specific landing pages where you want to eliminate exit routes.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/remove-related-product-section/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/basic-plugin-configuration/remove-related-product-section/)

**Hide Price from Single Product Page**

For B2B stores, wholesale catalogs, or "Call for Price" items, displaying a public price tag is often not desired. This feature enables you to hide the price from the WooCommerce single product page, allowing you to showcase products without revealing costs immediately.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/hide-price-cart-btn-short-description/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/basic-plugin-configuration/hide-price/)

**Hide Short Description**

In certain layouts, the short description pushes critical elements like the "Add to Cart" button too far down the page (below the fold). By using our single product page customizer, you can choose to hide the short description and optimize the screen real estate to prioritize the purchasing buttons. This optimization is vital for mobile users, where vertical screen space is at a premium. By reducing the need to scroll, you ensure the purchase action is instantly visible.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/hide-short-description/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/basic-plugin-configuration/hide-short-description/)

**Move Image Section to the Right Side**

To differentiate your store from the standard WooCommerce layout, this design option allows you to flip the page structure. By moving the product image gallery to the right side and the text to the left, you can offer a fresh, unique visual experience.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/lux-line-jumpsuit-2/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/move-image-section-to-right-side/)

**Related Product Categories Show as a Grid Format**

Instead of simply showing individual related products, you may want to encourage broader browsing. This feature in our single product page customizer allows you to display related product categories in an attractive grid format on the detail page. You can use this feature to customize the WooCommerce product page to encourage users to a deeper exploration of your catalog.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/display-related-product-categories-grid/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/display-related-product-categories-grid/)

= Text & Label Customization =

Whether you want to create a sense of urgency with custom sale badges, offer reassurance on WooCommerce backordered items, or simply rename tabs to be more descriptive, these text customization tools allow you to communicate more effectively. As a result, it serves great as a **WooCommerce backorder plugin**.

Single Product Page Customizer for WooCommerce is one of the best product page editor plugins for WordPress to make you wealthy with the feature-rich plugin for text & label customization.

**Change the Sale Badge text on WooCommerce**

The default "On Sale!" badge is often too generic to grab a customer's attention effectively. With this WooCommerce product page editor, you can replace the standard text with specific, high-impact messaging like "20% OFF," "Hot Deal," or "Limited Time" to better highlight your promotions.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/sale-badge-text-change/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/basic-plugin-configuration/change-sales-badge-text/)

**Out of Stock Text Change**

Standard "Out of Stock" messages can feel discouraging and lead to site exits. Customize this text to be more communicative or inviting, such as "Restocking Soon" or "Sold Out - Check Back Later." This keeps the customers interested even when inventory is low.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/out-of-stock-text-change/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/basic-plugin-configuration/out-of-stock-text/)

**On Backorder Text Change**

Managing customer expectations for WooCommerce backordered items is crucial to prevent disputes. This setting in our product customizer allows you to rewrite the default backorder notification to clearly explain the status, such as "Pre-order Now" or "Ships in 2 Weeks," ensuring transparency.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/on-backorder-text-change/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/on-backorder-text/)

**Customize Related Product Title**

The default heading "Related Products" is functional but not very persuasive. This tool allows you to rename the section title in a WooCommerce product page to something more engaging, like "You May Also Like," "Complete the Look," or "Customers Also Bought," to drive more clicks.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/related-title-change/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/related-products-title/)

**WooCommerce Default Tab Label Change**

Default tab labels like "Description" or "Additional Information" might not align with your specific content strategy. With our single product page customizer, you can easily rename these standard tabs to be more descriptive and brand-relevant, such as changing "Reviews" to "Customer Feedback."

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/default-tab-text-change/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/change-tab-default-label/)

= Advanced Content & Tabs =

Add custom content and specialized tabs directly into your product layout without touching a line of code. Download the Single Product Page Customizer now to effortlessly attach new information tabs alongside existing ones or display global message banners to alert users of important updates.

**Custom Message Show in Detail Page**

Customizing urgent information, such as shipping delays or special offers, is often difficult without editing the WooCommerce theme code or hiring a developer. This feature in our single product page customizer lets you insert a custom text message banner directly onto the product detail page to inform customers instantly.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/custom-message/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/enable-custom-message/)

**Custom Tab Attach with Before Existing WooCommerce Tab**

Standard product tabs are often insufficient for detailed information like sizing charts, video demos, or shipping policies. Our WooCommerce single product page customizer lets you create and attach new custom tabs to the product page and position them exactly where you need them relative to existing tabs.

[Live Demo](https://wsppc.webcartisan.com/product/add-tab/) | [Documentation](https://webcartisan.com/docs/single-product-customizer-for-woocommerce/advance-plugin-configuration/enable-custom-tab/)

**Additional Content to Attach in the Detail Page**

Sometimes store owners need to add specific content to areas outside the standard description field. This feature provides flexible hooks to inject custom content (text, HTML, or media) into various locations on the single product page. As a result, this allows you to deeply customize WooCommerce product pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does WooCommerce Product Page Customizer do? =
It gives you full control over your single product layout and features. You can customize the product page with a variation table, AJAX-powered add-to-cart, quantity plus minus (+/–) buttons, custom tabs, and extra content sections​. In practice, it lets you adjust or hide almost any element on the product page (price, SKU, short description, etc.) and add your own messages or layout tweaks for a better shopping experience. All these tools help improve the user experience and can boost conversions on your WooCommerce site​.

= Is it compatible with my WordPress/WooCommerce site and themes? =
The plugin is designed for WooCommerce and works with WordPress 4.0 or higher (tested With Latest version)​. It should work with any standard WooCommerce theme. However, note that because it relies on WooCommerce action hooks, it may not override product layouts that are fully built with page builders (Elementor, Divi, etc.). In sites where the entire product template is controlled by a builder, some customizations might not appear unless the builder's template supports those WooCommerce hooks​.

= Is mobile responsiveness supported? =
Yes! All customizations are mobile-friendly by default. Preview and tweak designs for mobile devices directly in the editor.

= Can I customize product badges, pricing, or stock messages? =
Absolutely. For example, you can replace the default "Sale!" badge text with your own message and even hide the price display entirely if desired. You can also customize stock/status messages: the default "Out of Stock" or "On Backorder" text can be replaced with your own messages to better fit your brand.

= How do I enable the plus/minus quantity buttons and set limits? =
The plugin lets you turn on a quantity spinner with plus/minus controls for easier quantity selection. In the free version, you can simply enable these buttons (no coding needed).

The plugin also supports AJAX add-to-cart (no page reloads) – this smooth, faster cart action is available in the Pro version​.

= How can I hide product metadata or unwanted sections (SKU, categories, short description)? =
The plugin provides simple toggles to remove or hide product meta information. You can strip out the product meta (SKU, categories, tags), disable the related products or upsells section, hide customer review stars, and even hide the short description​. This lets you declutter the page and focus customer attention on what matters.

= How can I customize product variations or related product sections? =
You have multiple options: the plugin can enable a variation switcher or a variation table on the product page​. This displays product variations (sizes, colors, etc.) in a clean, user-friendly way. You can also change the "Reset Variations" button text, and rename the titles of the Related Products or Upsells sections (e.g. change "Related Products" to "You May Also Like"). These features help tailor the shopping experience around your product variations and recommendations.

= Can I add custom fields (e.g., size charts, FAQs) to product pages? =
Yes! Use the drag-and-drop editor to add custom text, images, buttons, or even shortcodes to any section of the product page.

= Can I add Additional tab with WooCommerce default tab? =
Yes, you can add additional custom tab by using this plugin.

= Is there a Pro version, and what additional features does it include? =
A Pro (paid) version is available with advanced customization options. In addition to all the above, the Pro version lets you set global or product-specific min/max quantity limits and step values, show custom validation messages for quantity, and enable AJAX add-to-cart.
