##Frequently Asked Questions

### What does WooCommerce Product Page Customizer do?
    It gives you full control over your single product layout and features. You can customize the product page with a variation table, AJAX-powered add-to-cart,        quantity plus minus (+/–) buttons, custom tabs, and extra content sections​. In practice, it lets you adjust or hide almost any element on the product page (price,      SKU, short description, etc.) and add your own messages or layout tweaks for a better shopping experience. All these tools help improve the user experience and can     boost conversions on your WooCommerce site​.

### Is it compatible with my WordPress/WooCommerce site and themes?
    The plugin is designed for WooCommerce and works with WordPress 4.0 or higher (tested With Latest version)​. It should work with any standard WooCommerce theme.         However, note that because it relies on WooCommerce action hooks, it may not override product layouts that are fully built with page builders (Elementor, Divi,         etc.). In sites where the entire product template is controlled by a builder, some customizations might not appear unless the builder’s template supports those         WooCommerce hooks​. 

### Is mobile responsiveness supported?
    Yes! All customizations are mobile-friendly by default. Preview and tweak designs for mobile devices directly in the editor.

### Can I customize product badges, pricing, or stock messages?
    Absolutely. For example, you can replace the default “Sale!” badge text with your own message and even hide the price display entirely if desired. You can also         customize stock/status messages: the default “Out of Stock” or “On Backorder” text can be replaced with your own messages to better fit your brand. 

### How do I enable the plus/minus quantity buttons and set limits?
    The plugin lets you turn on a quantity spinner with plus/minus controls for easier quantity selection. In the free version, you can simply enable these buttons (no     coding needed). For advanced control, the Pro version adds min/max quantity limits and custom validation (so you can enforce minimum or maximum purchase amounts        per product). 

### Can I change or hide the “Add to Cart” button, and use AJAX add-to-cart?
    Yes. You can change the “Add to Cart” button text or hide the button entirely via the plugin’s settings​. This is useful if you want to replace it with a custom         link or hide it until certain conditions are met. The plugin also supports AJAX add-to-cart (no page reloads) – this smooth, faster cart action is available in the     Pro version​. 

### How can I hide product metadata or unwanted sections (SKU, categories, short description)? 
    The plugin provides simple toggles to remove or hide product meta information. You can strip out the product meta (SKU, categories, tags), disable the related         products or upsells section, hide customer review stars, and even hide the short description​. This lets you declutter the page and focus customer attention on what     matters. 

### Can I add custom messages or additional content to the product page?
    instance, you might add a promotional banner, a guarantee message, or extra instructions next to the description. The plugin settings let you choose where this         custom content appears. In the Pro version you can also create new custom tabs or rename existing ones (e.g. “Additional Information” or “Reviews”) to include         extended content.

### How can I customize product variations or related product sections?
    You have multiple options: the plugin can enable a variation switcher or a variation table on the product page​. This displays product variations (sizes, colors,        etc.) in a clean, user-friendly way. You can also change the “Reset Variations” button text, and rename the titles of the Related Products or Upsells sections         (e.g. change “Related Products” to “You May Also Like”). These features help tailor the shopping experience around your product variations and recommendations. 

### Can I add custom fields (e.g., size charts, FAQs) to product pages?
    Yes! Use the drag-and-drop editor to add custom text, images, buttons, or even shortcodes to any section of the product page. 

### Does the plugin slow down my site?
    No. The plugin is optimized for performance and uses lightweight code to ensure fast loading times.  

### Do I need coding skills to use this plugin?
    Not at all! The intuitive drag-and-drop interface lets anyone create professional product pages without writing a single line of code.  

### Is it compatible with page builders like Elementor?
    Yes! The plugin integrates seamlessly with Elementor, Divi, and other popular page builders for advanced customization.  

### Can I create unique layouts for different products?
    Definitely! Assign custom designs to specific products, categories, or tags using conditional logic.

### Variation swatches is available?

### How to use WooCommerce variation swatches?

### Is there a Pro version, and what additional features does it include?
     A Pro (paid) version is available with advanced customization options. In addition to all the above, the Pro version lets you set global or product-specific           min/max quantity limits and step values, show custom validation messages for quantity, and enable AJAX add-to-cart. It also unlocks category-based or per-product       rules, the ability to add multiple custom tabs and content sections, and layout changes like moving the product image to the right side​. These extras give              developers and designers even more control over the single-product page design and behavior. 

### Is the plugin actively maintained and where can I get support?
